"""Build ``.mining_signals_verified.json`` from approved Glyph Forge
sidecars.

The signature recognizer's lexicon is built by multiplier-expanding
each ``scanSignature`` base in the mining chart (``base * n`` for
``n in 1..25``). That covers most chart-listed signatures but
empirically misses combinations the chart-export pipeline never
emits — values like 10000, 26000, 14000, 21565, 8276, 2000 that the
user has manually labeled via Glyph Forge + Row Reviewer but the
chart doesn't list.

When the CRNN reads one of those missing values correctly at high
confidence, the lexicon-gate rejects it as "off-chart" and falls
through to the broken legacy stack. Closing the lexicon gap with a
union of user-verified values fixes the rejection without
introducing any new pipeline machinery.

This script walks both the SC_Toolbox dev tree and the WingmanAI
distribution tree for ``*.glyphs.json`` sidecars, takes those with
``review_status == "approved"``, extracts each one's ``label`` field
(e.g. ``"10,000"``), strips non-digits, and writes the unique integer
set to ``.mining_signals_verified.json`` at the tree root.

The file's schema is intentionally minimal::

    {
        "schema": "verified_signals_v1",
        "values": [2000, 8276, 10000, ...]
    }

Loaded at api.py boot via ``_load_verified_signal_values()``.

Run:
    python scripts/build_verified_signals_cache.py
